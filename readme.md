# SRC internship test

## Task
You need to implement operations for sparse matrices stored in a row major format:
- Matrix multiplication
- Raising to an integer power `p` (using matrix multiplication)

## Matrix format
- `SparseMatrix` is a list/vector of (sorted!) list/vectors of `Element`-s.
- `Element` has index and value of a non-zero element.
